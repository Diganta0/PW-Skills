        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a simple, high-level programming language. It is popular because it is easy to read and write, and it can be used for many different tasks, like web development, data analysis, and automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter is a program that reads and runs your Python code line by line. It translates your code into a language the computer understands.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords are special words that have a fixed meaning and cannot be changed. They are used to define the structure of the language like\n",
        "  if, else, and for.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they have a specific purpose in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability is the ability to change or modify an object after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - Lists are mutable because they are designed to be flexible and allow adding, removing, or changing elements.\n",
        "  - Tuples are immutable to ensure that their data remains constant and cannot be accidentally changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?\n",
        "  - The \"==\" operator checks if two objects have the same value. The \"is\" operator checks if two objects are the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. The main ones are and, or, and not.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. hat is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. For example, changing a string like \"10\" into an integer\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit: This happens automatically without you needing to write any code. For example, adding an integer to a float will result in a float.\n",
        "  - Explicit: This is when you manually convert a data type using a function like int(), str(), or float().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions. They run a block of code only if a certain condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The elif statement is kind of like \"else if\". It lets you check for more than one condition after an initial if statement. It only runs if the previous if and elif conditions were false.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - for loops are used when you know exactly how many times you want to loop.\n",
        "  - while loops are used when you want to loop as long as a certain condition is true. You don't need to know the number of loops beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  - A while loop is better when you need to repeat something until a specific event happens, like waiting for user input or processing data from a file until you reach the end."
