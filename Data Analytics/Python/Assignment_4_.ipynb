        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - OOP is a way of writing computer programs using \"objects\" that can contain data and code. The goal is to model real-world things and make code more organized and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the data and methods that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class. It is a real item created from the class blueprint, with its own specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction means showing only the necessary details and hiding the complex background information.\n",
        "  - Encapsulation means bundling data and the methods that work on that data into a single unit (an object). It protects the data from being changed directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods are special methods with names that start and end with two underscores, like `__init__` or `__str__`. They are also called magic methods and are used to control how objects behave.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance is a way for a new class (child class) to get the data and methods from an existing class (parent class). This helps in reusing code and building a family of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means you can use a single function name to perform different actions depending on the object it's used on.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using naming conventions with underscores to suggest that an attribute should not be accessed directly. A single underscore (`_`) suggests a \"protected\" member, and a double underscore (`__`) suggests a \"private\" member.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor is a special method used to create and initialize an object of a class. In Python, the constructor method is always named `__init__`.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - A class method is a method that belongs to the class itself, not to a specific object. It takes the class as the first argument, usually named cls.\n",
        "  - A static method is a method that doesn't belong to the class or an object. It's just a simple function that is grouped with the class for organization. It does not take cls or self as an argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading is when you have multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different arguments. Python does not support this feature directly like some other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding is when a child class provides a new implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - The property decorator is used to make a class method behave like a property (attribute). It lets you get, set, or delete a value using simple syntax, while running code behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is important because it makes code more flexible and reusable. It allows you to write generic code that can work with different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class is a class that cannot be used to create objects directly. It is designed to be a blueprint for other classes and often contains abstract methods that must be implemented by its child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - The advantages of OOP include code reuse through inheritance, better organization, easier troubleshooting, and the ability to model real-world problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - A class variable is shared by all objects of a class. It is defined outside any method.\n",
        "  - An instance variable is unique to each object. It is defined inside a method, usually `__init__`, using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to get features from all its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
        "  - `__str__` provides a human-readable string representation of an object. It's what is returned when you use print().\n",
        "  - `__repr__` provides an official string representation that can be used to recreate the object. It's more for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function is used in a child class to call a method from its parent class. This is helpful when you are overriding a parent method but still want to use some of its functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "  - The `__del__` method is the destructor. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed or its memory is about to be released.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - @staticmethod is a decorator for a method that doesn't need to access the class or the object instance. It takes no special first argument like self or cls.\n",
        "  - @classmethod is a decorator for a method that gets the class itself (cls) as its first argument. It can be used to create an object or modify a class variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - With inheritance, polymorphism allows a single method call to behave differently based on the object's class. For example, a speak() method on an Animal parent class can be overridden by a Dog child class to make a \"Bark!\" sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining is a way to call multiple methods on the same object in a single line. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "  - The `__call__` method makes an object callable like a function. When you try to call an object, this method is automatically executed."
