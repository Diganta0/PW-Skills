        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "  - Interpreted languages run line by line (like Python), while compiled languages are first converted into machine code and then executed (like C, Java).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "  - It is a way to deal with errors in code using try, except, finally, and else blocks so the program doesnâ€™t crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "  - The finally block runs no matter what happens, usually for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python\n",
        "  - Logging is recording important events, errors, or information in a program for debugging and tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python\n",
        "  - The `__del__` method is a destructor, called when an object is deleted, used to clean up resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "  - import module brings the whole module, while from module import x brings only specific functions or variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "  - Use multiple except blocks or combine exceptions in a tuple like except (TypeError, ValueError):.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "  - It automatically opens and closes the file safely without needing close().\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "  - Multithreading runs multiple threads inside one process (good for I/O tasks), while multiprocessing runs separate processes (good for CPU-heavy tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "  - It helps track errors, debug, monitor performance, and keep a record of program behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python\n",
        "  - It is how Python handles memory allocation and freeing using a private heap and garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "  - Use try to run code, except to handle errors, else for code if no error, and finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "  - It avoids memory leaks, keeps performance smooth, and ensures resources are used properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "  - try contains risky code, and except handles errors if they occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "  - It frees unused memory by deleting objects with zero references.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "  - The else block runs only if no exception happens inside try.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "  - DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "  - os.fork() works only on Unix and makes a child process, while multiprocessing works on all platforms and is more user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "  - Closing a file frees resources and ensures changes are saved properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "  - read() reads the whole file, while readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "  - It is used to log messages at different levels for debugging and tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "  - It helps with file operations like creating, removing, checking paths, and working with directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "  - Issues include memory leaks, large object handling, and high memory use with big data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "  - Use the raise keyword, e.g., raise ValueError(\"Error message\").\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - It improves performance for I/O-bound tasks like downloading files or handling many users at once."
